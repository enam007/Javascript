In javascript every value is either an object or Primitive value and a value is only primitive when the value is not an object
There are 7 primitive data types
a. Number (Decimal or integers eg. let age = 23)
b. String (Used for text eg. let firstName = 'Aamir')
c. Boolean (Used for taking decision eg. let isVisible = true)

d. Undefined (Value taken by variable that is not yet defined eg. let children)

e. Null (empty value)

f. Symbol (Value that is Unique and cannot be changed)

g.BigInt (For large number)

Also javascript support dynamic typing as in python i.e. we do not define the data type manually

ways of declaring variable in javascript 
let , const , var
We use let when we want to mutate the value further in code

we use const for a value which is constant also we cann't declare empty variable

var is almost same as let
